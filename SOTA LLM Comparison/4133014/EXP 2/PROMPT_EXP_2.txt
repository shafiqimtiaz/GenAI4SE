Old Comment:
Verifies that the username matches the user whose connections are being managed by this
factory and closes the pool if this is the case; otherwise does nothing.

New Code:
@Override
public void closePool(final String userName) throws SQLException {
  synchronized(this) {
    if (userName == null || !userName.equals(this.userName)) {
      return;
    }
  }
  try {
    pool.close();
  } catch (final Exception ex) {
    throw new SQLException("Error closing connection pool", ex);
  }
}
